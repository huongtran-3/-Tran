## Welcome to my website ^_^

I am currently doing PhD at the University of Manchester. I am part of a cohort of students enrolled in the CDT programme in Data Analytics and Society. My research is entitled Advancing the use of Administrative Data in Official Statistics where I will be working along with The Office for National Statistics (ONS).

My journey as an economist started from the National University of Ho Chi Minh city,Vietnam, with a few years of experience as an entrepreneur. As I learned more about Economics and Statistics, I moved into Italy, after walking past the legendary Leaning Tower every day for two years to go to the University of Pisa to do my European Master in Official Statistics(EMOS).
I had done my internship at INSEE in Paris, where can you learn about data better, other than the biggest metro in Europe. I always had a flair for data mapping, I have always been interested in exploring the relationship between culture and economics, I aspire to meet different people from different streams, backgrounds, and ideas which would enrich my knowledge and guide me for my future quest"

My research's interests:

Survey Statistics 
Small Area Estimation 
administrative data 
Big data
