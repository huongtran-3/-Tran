## Welcome to my website

I am currently doing PhD at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). I am part of a cohort of students 
enrolled in the [Centre for Doctoral Training-CDT](https://datacdt.org/) programme in Data Analytics and Society. My research 
is entitled [Advancing the use of Administrative Data in Official Statistics](phd-topic) where I will be working along with 
The [Office for National Statistics (ONS)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/).

My journey started from the National University of Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. As I learned more about Statistics and scocial 
science, I moved into Italy, after walking past the legendary Leaning Tower every day for two years to go to the University of 
Pisa to do my European Master in Official Statistics (EMOS).
I had done my internship at INSEE in Paris, where can you learn about data better, other than the biggest metro in Europe. I 
always had a flair for data mapping, I have always been interested in exploring the relationship between social issue and 
data, I aspire to meet different people from different streams, backgrounds, and ideas which would enrich my knowledge and
guide me for my future quest.

My research's interests:

- Survey methodology
- Small Area Estimation 
- Administrative data 
- Big data
