## Hello world!

### About me ^_^

I am Tran Huong from Vietnam. I am currently a PhD student from the [Centre for Doctoral Training-CDT](https://datacdt.org/)  in Data Analytics and Society programme at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). My research is entitled [Advancing the use of Administrative Data in Official Statistics](phd-topic) which cooperates with The [Office for National Statistics (ONS)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/).

My journey started from the National University of Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. As I learned more about Statistics and scocial science, I moved into Italy, after walking past the legendary Leaning Tower every day for two years to go to the University of Pisa to do my European Master in Official Statistics (EMOS). I had done my internship at INSEE in Paris, where can you learn about data better, other than the biggest metro in Europe. I always had a flair for data mapping, I have always been interested in exploring the relationship between social issue and data, I aspire to meet different people from different streams, backgrounds, and ideas which would enrich my knowledge and guide me for my future quest.
