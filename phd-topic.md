# Advancing the use of Administrative data in Official Statistics

### Research topic

The research is about the Quality of administrative data, the Linkage of data, the Privacy and Confidentiality, the Estimation
of data, the Statistical Data Editing. 

The research focus on measuring and communicating uncertainty of outputs including quality measures for estimates using administrative data, developing the total administrative data error framework, and the linking multiple sources with possible different hierarchies, developing methodology and tools and measures of quality for linked data. In addition, the Privacy and Confidentiality is considered which related to generating synthetic data and assessing disclosure risk and data utility, new forms of data dissemination, investigating the potential of differential privacy. The Estimation in administrative data is comparison of administrative data sources with survey data and identifying and addressing under or over-coverage issues using case studies and applications.Statistical Data Editing is the editing and imputation, data cleaning and harmonization of administrative data sources. Transactional Data is transactional (streamed) data and dealing with time lags and combining aggregate data using time series approaches.

The Administrative Data Research programme cooporates with The Office for National Statistics (ONS) with series of tasks in
a preliminary work plan to advance the use of administrative data in official statistics.
