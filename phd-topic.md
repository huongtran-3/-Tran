# Advancing the use of Administrative data in Official Statistics
## PhD topic

Technology is evolving rapidly, featuring the Industry 4.0 technology, revolutionizing all domains of economics including data 
analytics. Data management is increasingly important, in the digital technology era, data is very large and needs to be 
effectively managed, from which data is used effectively, resulting in good results for research. Because of the importance in 
research about data, the project ‘Advancing the Use of Administrative Data in Official Statistics’ is essential nowadays. Many 
term in data has researched in particular administrative, big data and the related approaches to analyze data (data analytics 
or predictive analytics). The using survey data in official statistic is familiar, as the same like using of administrative 
data in official statistic. However, there has not been much research on advancing the Use of Administrative Data in Official 
Statistics in the present time. As well as the constant change of technology and trends, updated research is always needed, 
because it brings high application efficiency.
The research aims to improve the knowledge about advancing the Use of Administrative Data in Official Statistics by 
specific areas to explore. In particular, the research task is about the quality of administrative data, linkage of data, the 
Privacy and Confidentiality, the estimation of data, the Statistical Data Editing, the Statistical Data Editing.
The research about “Quality” of administrative data is measuring and communicating uncertainty of outputs including quality 
measures/intervals for estimates using administrative data and developing the ‘Total Administrative Data Error’ framework.
This is important to learn about data and learn how data linkage. Linkage of data is linking multiple sources with possible 
different hierarchies, developing methodology and tools and measures of quality for linked data.
Privacy and Confidentiality is generating synthetic data and assessing disclosure risk and data utility, new forms of data 
dissemination, investigating the potential of differential privacy.
Estimation in administrative data is comparison of administrative data sources with survey data and identifying and addressing 
under or over-coverage issues using case studies and applications.
Statistical Data Editing is the editing and imputation, data cleaning and harmonization of administrative data sources. 
Transactional Data is transactional (streamed) data and dealing with time lags and combining aggregate data using time series 
approaches
